# Prime_number
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.

Write a program that get input from user than show how many iteration need to find out if number is prime or not. If number is not prime (composite) you should give factor(s) of given number. Application should run in text UI mode.

Application should implement following two methods:  

Method I: Should use regular calculation method. It should divide every positive number available between 1 and less than given value itself ( 1 < divider < n)

Method II: Should use algorithm that was mentioned in online class. Check it out slides.

---------------------------------------Example Program Execution----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please give a number-> 12
12 is composite number and factors are -> 2,3
With 1st method number of iteration  is: 10
With 2nd method number of iteration  is: 3

Please give a number-> 101
101 is prime number and factors are -> 
With 1st method number of iteration  is: 99
With 2nd method number of iteration  is: 3
